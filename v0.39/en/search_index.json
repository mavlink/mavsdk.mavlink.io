Instead, methods that can fail return success or an error reason as enum values.\n\n The error code usually reflects acknowledgment from the vehicle that it will perform the requested action (or not).\n  The operation itself may not yet have completed (e.g. taking off).\n\nThe various classes also all provide stream operators for getting human readable strings from their associated result enum.\nYou can see how these are used in the example code.\nCallbacks\nSome of the APIs use callbacks, e.g. subscriptions to a stream like Telemetry::subscribe_position(PositionCallback callback) or async functions like Action::takeoff_async(ResultCallback callback).\nAll user callbacks are called from one thread.\nUsers must not do anything inside a callback that takes a long time to complete, as this will stall subsequent callbacks.\nFor more information on how to work with and debug callbacks see Troubleshooting.\nShared Vehicle Control\nA vehicle can receive commands from multiple sources, including a Ground Control Station, or other MAVLink applications.\nSDK applications, which are running in environments where it is possible, can explicitly monitor for changes in flight mode (outside application control) and change behaviour appropriately (e.g. using Telemetry::subscribe_flight_mode()).\nAPI Limitations/Behaviour\nSupported Vehicles\nThe SDK has been designed to manage aircraft that use the PX4 autopilot.\nIt has primarily been tested for use with multicopters, but also has basic support for fixed wing and VTOL.\nThe APIs include methods that do not make sense for other vehicle types - including \"takeoff\" and \"land\".\nWhile ground vehicles may work, they are not supported and are untested.\nSimilarly, other autopilots may well work, but, they are not explicitly supported and are untested.\nConnection Strings \nMAVSDK monitors a specified port for vehicles (for the C++ API see Connecting to Systems (Vehicles)).\nAll programming language libraries reference this port using a connection string with the following format:\n\n\n\nConnection\nURL Format\n\n\n\n\nUDP\nudp://[Bind_host][:Bind_port]\n\n\nTCP\ntcp://[Server_host][:Server_port]\n\n\nSerial\nserial://[Dev_Node][:Baudrate]\n\n\n\nConcrete examples are for different platforms are:\n\n\n\nConnection type\nString\nExample\n\n\n\n\nWindows connected to the vehicle via USB (includes USB-connected Telemetry radios).\nserial:///COMn,  where n = the COM port. Note: /// will change to // in a future release (incorrect on Windows).\nserial:///COM1\n\n\nLinux (e.g Raspberry Pi) connected to the vehicle via Serial port\nserial:///dev/ttyACMn,  where n = the port\nserial:///dev/ttyACM0\n\n\nLinux connected to the vehicle via USB\nserial:///dev/ttyUSBn,  where n = the port\nserial:///dev/ttyUSB0\n\n\nmacOS connected to the vehicle via Serial port\nserial:///dev/tty.usbserial-n,  where n = the USB device id\nserial:///dev/tty.usbserial-DA00AG57\n\n\nmacOS connected to the vehicle via USB\nserial:///dev/tty.usbmodem-n,  where n = the USB device id\nserial:///dev/tty.usbmodem--DA00AG57\n\n\nSITL connected to the vehicle via UDP\nudp://:14540\n\n\n\nConnection Status\nA system is considered to be disconnected (timed-out) if its heartbeat message is not detected within 3 seconds.\nTelemetry/Information\nThe SDK gets and stores vehicle state/telemetry information from received MAVLink messages.\nThe information is supplied to callback subscribers as soon as message updates are received.\nClients can also query the API synchronously, and will get the information from the last received message (depending on channel latency, this information will become increasingly \"stale\" between messages).\nThe rate at which update messages are sent by the vehicle can be specified using the API (but will be limited by the bandwidth of the channel).\nDevelopers need to use a channel and a message update rate that allows their desired control algorithm to be effective - there is no point trying to use computer vision over an unreliable high-latency link.\nInfo information does not change for a particular vehicle, so will be accurate whenever read.\nActions/Offboard\nAction methods (and any other \"vehicle instructions\") return when the vehicle has confirmed that the message was received and will be acted on (or not).\nThe methods do not wait for the commanded action to complete.\nSo, for example, the Action::land() method returns as soon as the vehicle confirms it will land, but will actually land at some later point.\nThe implication is that developers will need to separately monitor the completion of the requested actions, if this is important to the application.\nMissions\nThe Mission and MissionItem APIs provide a the most useful subset of MAVLink mission commands as a developer-friendly API.\nNot every mission command behaviour supported by the protocol and PX4 will be supported by the SDK.\nFor example, at time of writing the API does not allow you to specify commands that jump back to previous mission items.\nThe API allows you to download/import missions.\nNote however that this will fail if the mission contains a command that is not supported by the API.\n  © Dronecode 2017-2020.

The default update rate depends on the autopilot and may also be limited by the characteristics of the communications channel.\nYou can set the rate for each type of telemetry, and both synchronous or asynchronous rate-setting methods are provided.\n\n For PX4 running on hardware the default rates are set on a per-mode basis in mavlink_main.cpp (search on configure_stream).\n  For PX4 running on SITL, the default rates are defined in the startup file.\n\nThe rate-setting methods are all used in the same way, so we just show one example for both the asynchronous and synchronous methods below.\nIn both cases we set the rate for position updates.\nTo set the position update rate synchronously (in this case using set_rate_position()):\n// Set position update rate to 1 Hz.\nconst Telemetry::Result set_rate_result = telemetry.set_rate_position(1.0);\nif (set_rate_result != Telemetry::Result::Success) {\n    // handle rate-setting failure (in this case print error)\n    std::cout \nTo set the position update rate asynchronously with set_rate_position_async() (here we use a promise to block until we have a result):\n{\n    std::cout >();\n    auto future_result = prom->get_future();\n    // Set position update rate to 1 Hz.\n    telemetry.set_rate_position_async(1.0, [prom](Telemetry::Result result) {\n        prom->set_value(result); //fulfill promise\n    });\n\n    //Block until promise is fulfilled (in callback function)\n    const Telemetry::Result result = future_result.get();\n    if (result != Telemetry::Result::Success) {\n        // handle rate-setting failure (in this case print error)\n        std::cout \nGetting Regular Updates\nThe best way to get telemetry updates is to use the asynchronous methods.\nThese methods are non-blocking; they take a callback function argument and return immediately.\nThe callback will be invoked with a populated struct of the associated type as soon as an update message arrives from the vehicle.\nThe rate at which this occurs can be set through the API as discussed above.\nFor example, the Telemetry::subscribe_position() has the following prototype, where callback is called with a populated PositionCallback function:\nvoid mavsdk::Telemetry::subscribe_position(PositionCallback callback)\n\nThe code fragment below shows this method being use with a lambda function for the callback, which simply prints out the current position and altitude).\ntelemetry.subscribe_position([](Telemetry::Position position) {\n    std::cout \nDetecting Changes (only)\nThe asynchronous callbacks are updated every time new information is provided by the vehicle.\nFor some types of telemetry you may only wish to report only when the value changes.\nThe example below shows how to use subscribe_flight_mode() to report only when the current flight mode changes.\nThe example uses a lambda function callback that captures a variable for the last mode.\nThis variable is compared to the current flight mode to determine whether the value has changed and needs to be reported.\n// Set up callback to monitor flight mode 'changes'\nTelemetry::FlightMode oldFlightMode=Telemetry::FlightMode::Unknown;\ntelemetry.subscribe_flight_mode([&oldFlightMode](Telemetry::FlightMode flightMode) {\n    if (oldFlightMode != flightMode) {\n        //Flight mode changed. Print!\n        std::cout \nYou can stop flight mode updates altogether with:\ntelemetry.subscribe_flight_mode(nullptr);\n\nThis same approach can be used to report only messages that meet some condition.\n\n In future we may add a mechanism in the API to support just reporting changes: Issue #63.\n\nBlocking Telemetry Requests (State Management)\nSome commands/vehicle operations must be performed in a certain sequence, or can only be called when the vehicle reaches a certain state.\nFor example, in order to takeoff the vehicle must first be armed, and in order to arm, the vehicle must have a home position/GPS lock.\nFor these cases you will want to monitor for the vehicle being in a certain state and block other commands until it is ready to proceed.\nOften the easiest approach is to use synchronous methods and poll for the result.\nFor example, the following code shows how you might poll for whether the vehicle is ready to arm (health_all_ok()).\n// Check if vehicle is ready to arm\nwhile (!telemetry.health_all_ok()) {\n    std::cout \nSimilarly, you can use the asynchronous method and block\n{\n    std::cout >();\n    auto future_result = prom->get_future();\n    telemetry.subscribe_health_all_ok(\n    [prom](bool result) {\n        //fulfill promise if health is OK\n        if (result) {// health OK\n            prom->set_value();\n        }\n    });\n\n    future_result.get(); //Block until promise is fulfilled.\n    // Now ready to arm\n}\n\n\n Note that prom->set_value() must only be called once.\n  If your code can potentially call this multiple times, remember to unsubscribe from the callback after it succeeds (e.g. using telemetry.subscribe_all_ok(nullptr)).\n\nDepending on the architecture of your application, you may even wish to arm the vehicle in your callback function.\nUsually though it is easier to understand program flow using the approach above.\nFurther Information\nAdditional information/examples for the Telemetry API are linked below:\n\nSDK Examples\nIntegration tests:\ntelemetry_async.cpp\ntelemetry_health.cpp\ntelemetry_modes.cpp\ntelemetry_sync.cpp\n\n\n\n  © Dronecode 2017-2020.

If a takeoff command is accepted the vehicle will change to the Takeoff mode, fly to the takeoff altitude, and then hover (in takeoff mode) until another instruction is received.\n\n PX4/SDK also provides other ways to take off:\n\nA copter or VTOL will take off automatically if a mission is started (fixed-wing will not).\nYou can also take off by manually driving the vehicle using the offboard API.\n\n\nThe vehicle will only take off once armed, and can only arm once it is \"healthy\" (has been calibrated, the home position has been set, and there is a high-enough quality GPS lock). After it starts flying, code needs to check that takeoff is complete before sending additional instructions.\nHealth Check\nThe code fragment below shows very simple code to synchronously poll for health status (using Telemetry:health_all_ok()) prior to arming:\n// Wait until health is OK and vehicle is ready to arm\nwhile (telemetry.health_all_ok() != true) {\n    std::cout \nThe code fragment below performs the same task, but additionally exits the app if calibration is required reports what conditions are still required before the vehicle is \"healthy\":\n\n// Exit if calibration is required\nTelemetry::Health check_health = telemetry.health();\nbool calibration_required = false;\nif (!check_health.gyrometer_calibration_ok) {\n    std::cout \n\n Vehicle health can also be checked using Telemetry:subscribe_health_all_ok().\n\nArming\nOnce the vehicle is ready, use the following synchronous code to arm:\n// Arm vehicle\nstd::cout \n\n If the arm() method returns Action::Result::Success then the vehicle is armed and can proceed to takeoff. This can be confirmed using Telemetry::armed().\n\nGet/Set Takeoff Altitude\nThe default/current takeoff altitude can be queried using get_takeoff_altitude().\nThis target can be changed at any point before takeoff using set_takeoff_altitude().\nThe code fragment below shows how to set the takeoff altitude to 3 metres:\naction.set_takeoff_altitude(3.0);\n\nTakeoff Action\nOnce the vehicle is armed it can be commanded to take off.\nThe code below uses the synchronous takeoff() method, and fails if the vehicle refuses the command:\n// Command Take off\nstd::cout \nIf the command succeeds the vehicle will takeoff, and hover at the takeoff altitude. Code should wait until takeoff has completed before sending the next instruction. Unfortunately there is no specific indicator to inform code that takeoff is complete.\n\n One alternative is to simply wait for enough time that the vehicle should have reached the takeoff altitude.\n\nThe code below checks for takeoff completion by polling the current altitude until the target altitude is reached:\nfloat target_alt=action.get_takeoff_altitude_m();\nfloat current_position=0;\nwhile (current_position\nLanding\nThe best way to land the vehicle at the current location is to use the land() or land_async() methods.\nIf the command is accepted the vehicle will change to the Land mode and land at the current point.\n\n The SDK does not at time of writing recommend other approaches for landing: land mission items are not supported and manually landing the vehicle using the offboard is not as safe.\n\nThe code below shows how to use the land action.\nconst Action::Result land_result = action.land();\nif (land_result != Action::Result::Success) {\n    //Land failed, so exit (in reality might try a return to land or kill.)\n    return 1;\n}\n\nThe vehicle should land and then automatically disarm.\nIf you want to monitor the landing you can trigger completion of the app based on the armed state, as shown below.\nwhile (telemetry.armed()) {\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n}\nstd::cout \nReturn/RTL\nReturn mode (also known as \"Return to Launch\", \"Return to Land\", \"Return to Home\") flies the vehicle back to the home position and may also land the vehicle (depending on vehicle configuration).\nThis mode is invoked from Action using the return_to_launch() or return_to_launch_async() methods.\nThe code below shows how to use the synchronous method:\nconst Action::Result rtl_result = telemetry.return_to_launch();\nif (rtl_result != Action::Result::Success) {\n    //RTL failed, so exit (in reality might send kill command.)\n    return 1;\n}\n\nDepending on the vehicle it may land or hover around the return point. For vehicles that are configured to land you can use the same code as in the previous section to determine when the vehicle has disarmed.\nDisarm/Kill\nUse the disarm or kill methods to stop the drone motors (the difference is that disarming will only succeed if the drone considers itself landed, while kill will disarm a vehicle even in flight).\nThe methods are listed below. These are used in the same way as other similar Action APIs:\n\ndisarm(), disarm_async\nkill(), kill_async\n\n\n PX4 will automatically disarm the vehicle after landing. The disarm methods explicitly invoke the same functionality.\n\nGet/Set Cruise Speed\nYou can get/set the normal horizontal velocity used in Return mode, Hold mode, Takeoff (and other AUTO Flight Modes using the following methods:\n\nset_maximum_speed()\nget_maximum_speed\n\n\n These methods get/set the MPC_XY_CRUISE parameter.\n  They are used in the same way as the other Action methods.\n\nSwitch Between VTOL Modes \nAction provides methods to transition between VTOL fixed wing and multicopter modes, with both synchronous and asynchronous versions:\n\ntransition_to_fixedwing(), transition_to_multicopter()\ntransition_to_fixedwing_async(), transition_to_multicopter_async()\n\nThe associated action will only be executed for VTOL vehicles (on other vehicle types the command will fail with a Result of VTOL_TRANSITION_SUPPORT_UNKNOWN or NO_VTOL_TRANSITION_SUPPORT).\nThe command will succeed if called when the vehicle is already in the mode.\nThe code fragment below shows how to call the synchronous action to transition to fixed wing,\nand to print the result of the call (the other synchronous method is used in the same way).\nconst Action::Result fw_result = action.transition_to_fixedwing();\n\nif (fw_result != Action::Result::Success) {\n    std::cout \nFurther Information\nAdditional information/examples for the Action API are linked below:\n\nExample: Takeoff and Land\nExample: VTOL Transitions\nIntegration tests:\naction_hover_async.cpp\naction_takeoff_and_kill.cpp\naction_transition_multicopter_fixedwing.cpp\n\n\n\n  © Dronecode 2017-2020.

If you require the full mission item spec as MAVLink provides it, you might be better off using the MissionRaw plugin.\nFurthermore MissionRaw allows importing mission from QGroundControl.\n\nSupported Mission Commands \nThe MissionItem class abstracts a small but useful subset of the mission commands supported by PX4 (and the MAVLink specification):\nThe supported set is:\n\nMAV_CMD_NAV_WAYPOINT\nMAV_CMD_DO_CHANGE_SPEED\nMAV_CMD_DO_MOUNT_CONTROL\nMAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE\nMAV_CMD_IMAGE_STOP_CAPTURE\nMAV_CMD_VIDEO_START_CAPTURE\nMAV_CMD_VIDEO_STOP_CAPTURE\nMAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_TIME\n\nAdditionally, the following commands are supported only for mission import/download (there are no corresponding MissionItem methods):\n\nMAV_CMD_NAV_LAND\nMAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF\n\n\n The Mission API does not (at time of writing) provide explicit functionality to \"repeat\", takeoff, return to land etc.\nThe SDK provides some omitted functionality through the Action API.\n\nCreate the Plugin\n\n Mission objects are created in the same way as other MAVSDK plugins.\n  General instructions are provided in the topic: Using Plugins.\n\nThe main steps are:\n\nLink the plugin library into your application.\nDo this by adding mavsdk_mission to the target_link_libraries section of the app's cmake build definition file\nfind_package(MAVSDK REQUIRED)\n\ntarget_link_libraries(your_application_name\n  MAVSDK::mavsdk\n  ...\n  MAVSDK::mavsdk_mission\n  ...\n)\n\n\nCreate a connection to a system.\nFor example (basic code without error checking):#include \nMavsdk mavsdk;\nConnectionResult conn_result = mavsdk.add_udp_connection();\n// Wait for the system to connect via heartbeat\nwhile (mavsdk.system().size() == 0) {\n   sleep_for(seconds(1));\n}\n// System got discovered.\nSystem system = mavsdk.systems()[0];\n\nCreate an instance of Mission with the system:#include \nauto mission = Mission{system};\n\n\nThe mission object can then used to access the plugin API (as shown in the following sections).\nDefining a Mission\nA mission must be defined as a vector of MissionItem objects as shown below:\nstd::vector> mission_items;\n\nYou can create as many MissionItem objects as you like and use std_vector::push_back() to add them to the back of the mission item vector.\nThe example below shows how to create and add a MissionItem that sets the target position.\n// Create MissionItem and set its position\nstd::shared_ptr new_item(new MissionItem());\nnew_item->latitude_deg = 47.40;\nnew_item->longitude_deg = 8.5455360114574432;\n\n// Add new_item to the vector\nmission_items.push_back(new_item);\n\nThe example below shows how you might set the other options on a second MissionItem (and add it to the mission).\nstd::shared_ptr new_item2(new MissionItem());\nnew_item2->latitude_deg = 47.40;\nnew_item2->longitude_deg = 8.5455360114574432);\nnew_item2->relative_altitude_m = 2.0f;\nnew_item2->speed_m_s = 5.0f;\nnew_item2->is_fly_through = true;\nnew_item2->gimbal_pitch_deg = 20.0f;\nnew_item2->gimbal_pitch_deg = 20.0f;\nnew_item2->gimbal_yaw_deg = 60.0f;\nnew_item2->camera_action = MissionItem::CameraAction::TakePhoto;\nnew_item2->loiter_time_s = 1.0f;\nnew_item2->camera_photo_interval_s =  1.0f;\n\n//Add new_item2 to the vector\nmission_items.push_back(new_item2);\n\n\n The autopilot has sensible default values for the attributes.\n  If you do set a value (e.g. the desired speed) then it will be the default for the remainder of the mission.\n\n\n\n There are also getter methods for querying the current value of MissionItem attributes.\n  The default values of most fields are NaN (which means they are ignored/not sent).\n\nThe mission (mission_items) can then be uploaded as shown in the section Uploading a Mission below.\nConvenience Function\nThe Fly Mission uses a convenience function to create MissionItem objects.\nUsing this approach you have to specify every attribute for every mission item, whether or not the value is actually used.\nThe definition and use of this function is shown below:\nstatic Mission::MissionItem make_mission_item(\n    double latitude_deg,\n    double longitude_deg,\n    float relative_altitude_m,\n    float speed_m_s,\n    bool is_fly_through,\n    float gimbal_pitch_deg,\n    float gimbal_yaw_deg,\n    Mission::MissionItem::CameraAction camera_action);\n\n\nmission_items.push_back(\n    make_mission_item(47.398170327054473,\n                      8.5456490218639658,\n                      10.0f, 5.0f, false,\n                      20.0f, 60.0f,\n                      MissionItem::CameraAction::NONE));\n\nUploading a Mission \nUse Mission::upload_mission() to upload the mission defined in the previous section.\nThe example below shows how this is done.\n// ... declare and populate the mission vector: mission_items\n\n{\n    std::cout \nStarting/Pausing Missions\nStart or resume a paused mission using Mission::start_mission.\nThe vehicle must already have a mission (the mission need not have been uploaded using the SDK).\nThe code fragment below shows how this is done.\n{\n    const Mission::Result result = mission.start_mission();\n\n    if (result != Mission::Result::Success) {\n        std::cout \nTo pause a mission use Mission::pause_mission().\nThe code is almost exactly the same as for starting a mission:\n{\n    std::cout \nMonitoring Progress\nAsynchronously monitor progress using Mission::subscribe_mission_progress(),\nwhich receives a regular callback with the current MissionItem number and the total number of items.\nThe code fragment just takes a lambda function that reports the current status.\nmission.subscribe_mission_progress( [](Mission::MissionProgress mission_progress)) {\n       std::cout \n\n The mission is complete when current == total.\n\nThe following synchronous methods is also available for checking mission progress:\n\nis_mission_finished() - Checks if mission has been finished.\n\nTaking Off, Landing, Returning\nIf using a copter or VTOL vehicle then PX4 will automatically takeoff when it is armed and a mission is started (even without a takeoff mission item).\nFor Fixed Wing vehicles the vehicle must be launched before starting a mission.\nAt time of writing the Mission API does not provide takeoff, land or \"return to launch\" MissionItems.\nIf required you can instead use the appropriate commands in the Action class.\n\nDownloading Missions\nUse Mission::download_mission() to download a mission from the vehicle.\nThe mission is downloaded as a vector of MissionItem objects, that you can then view or manipulate as required.\n\n Mission download will fail if the mission contains a command that is outside the supported set.\nMissions created using QGroundControl are not guaranteed to successfully download!\nAgain, for that case MissionRaw might be a better fit.\n\nThe code fragment below shows how to download a mission:\n{\n    std::cout  result = mission.download_mission();\n\n    if (result.first != Mission::Result::Success) {\n        std::cout \nFurther

If viewed from above, the vehicle will turn clockwise if the value is positive and anticlockwise if it is negative.\nCalling set_velocity_body() using an initialiser list type declaration the final (fourth) value is the yaw rate/direction.\nExamples:\n\nTurn clock-wise at 60 degrees per second:offboard.set_velocity_body({0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 60.0f});\n\n\nTurn anti clock-wise at 5 degrees per second:offboard.set_velocity_body({0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, -5.0f});\n\n\n\nFly Forwards\nUse set_velocity_body() to set the velocity components relative to the body frame.\nTo fly forwards, simply set the first parameter (Offboard::VelocityBodyYawspeed::forward_m_s) when the vehicle is not rotating.\noffboard.set_velocity_body({5.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f});\n\nFly a Circle\nTo fly a circle, use set_velocity_body() with both forward and rotational components.\nThis will force the vehicle to travel in a curved path.\noffboard.set_velocity_body({5.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 30.0f});\n\nYou can force the vehicle to fly sideways by using the (Offboard::VelocityBodyYawspeed::right_m_s value), and in the other direction by using a negative rotation value:\n// Fly a circle sideways\noffboard.set_velocity_body({0.0f, -5.0f, 0.0f, -30.0f});\n\nPosition/Thrust Setpoints\nThe SDK does not support position or thrust setpoints (at time of writing).\nWaiting on Setpoints\nThe vehicle will obey the last setpoint called (when you call a setpoint the last one is cleared).\nThe SDK examples use timers to separate commands (e.g. sleep_for(seconds(8))) but in a real-world use case you might use telemetry or sensors to control when the setpoint is changed.\nMonitoring Offboard Mode\nThe vehicle may change out of offboard mode outside the control of your application (for example if a GCS were to put the vehicle into Hold mode).\nIn this case, the SDK will automatically stop sending setpoints and Offboard::is_active() will change from true to false.\nCalls to change the setpoint do not return an error!\nDepending on the particular use case, offboard code may need to explicitly monitor for flight mode and change behaviour appropriately (e.g. using Telemetry::subscribe_flight_mode()).\nFurther Information\nAdditional information/examples for the Offboard API are linked below:\n\nExample: Offboard Velocity\nIntegration tests:\noffboard_velocity.cpp\n\n\n\n  © Dronecode 2017-2020.

The only requirement is that the build system must be able to locate the MAVSDK C++ headers and libraries (installed as described here).\nMAVSDK itself uses the cmake build system, and we recommend that you do too.\nCMake is an open-source, cross-platform toolchain that allows you to build your examples on macOS, Linux and Windows using the same build file definition.\nBelow we explain how to set up a minimal build setup (CMakeLists.txt) file for your application.\nBuild Definition File - CMakeLists.txt\nCmake uses a definition file named CMakeLists.txt to define the project.

Any other linked libraries\n)\n\n\n The file format and required modifications are self-explanatory.\nIf additional information is required see the cmake documentation.\n\nBuilding the App\nIn order to build the application, the MAVSDK library and header files need to be installed.\nMAVSDK Installed System-wide \nIf MAVSDK has been installed using the .deb or .rpm file from MAVSDK releases it is installed in /usr/, so system-wide.\nIf MAVSDK has been built from source and installed in /usr/local, we also consider that system-wide.\nFor this case find_package(MAVSDK REQUIRED) as used in CMakeLists.txt above should find the library automatically.\nTo build the example we would do:\n   cmake -Bbuild -H.\n   cmake --build build -j8\n\nMAVSDK Installed Locally \nFor Windows we need to install the library and header files locally by extracting mavsdk-windows-x64-release.zip file from MAVSDK releases.\nOn macOS/Linux, you can also use locally installed library artefacts by building from source if that is required (e.g. during development order not to conflict with system-wide installe library).\nFor the case where the library is installed in some local directory, you need to specify this path using the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.\nE.g. here there would be a directory called mavsdk just one directory up:\ncmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=../mavsdk -H.\ncmake --build build -j8\n\nRun the App\nTo Execute the file (in your build directory):\nbuild/your_executable_name  # Run your new executable\n\nRelease Build\nIn order to build in Release mode where the file size is smaller and optimizations are turned on, do:\nmacOS/Linux:\ncmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -H.\ncmake --build build -j8\nWindows:\ncmake -Bbuild -H.\ncmake --build build -j8 --config Release\nUseful Links\nWe only show a small fraction of what Cmake is capable of!

For Linux/macOS that's /usr/local, for Windows it is somewhere in C:\\Program Files.\nTo install system-wide the command needs to be run with sudo on Linux/macOS:\nsudo cmake --build build/default --target install\n\nor run in a command prompt with admin privileges on Windows, or using runas:\nrunas cmake --build build/default --target install\n\n\n Make sure to prevent conflicts between libraries installed in your system.\nThe mavsdk library installed via a .deb or .rpm file will be installed in /usr/ while the built library will be installed in /usr/local.\nIt's recommended to only have one installed at any time to prevent conflicts.\n\nLocal Install \nThe install path can be set in the configure call using CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:\nFor example, to install into the MAVSDK/install/ folder you woul set the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable to specify a path relative to the folder from which you call cmake (or an absolute path).\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -Bbuild/default -H.\ncmake --build build/default --target install\n\n If you already have run cmake without setting CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, you may need to clean the build first:\n  rm -rf build/default\n\n\nOther build flags\nDuring the configure step, there are various flags that an be set using -DFLAG=Value:\n\nCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: as documented above, to chose between Debug and Release build.\nCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: as documented above, to specify directory to install library artefacts.\nBUILD_SHARED_LIBS: set to ON to build dynamic libraries (such as .so on Linux, .dylib on macOS, .dll on Windows). Set to OFF to build static libraries (such as .a on Linux and macOS, .lib on Windows).\nSUPERBUILD: set to OFF to use system dependencies instead of dependencies downloaded and built using cmake.\nCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: can be used to set the path where the dependencies can be found if SUPERBUILD is set to OFF.\nBUILD_MAVSDK_SERVER: set to ON to build mavsdk_server, see instruction to build mavsdk_server.\nASAN: set to ON to enable address sanitizer.\nUBSAN: set to ON to enable undefined behavior sanitizer.\nLSAN: set to ON to enable leak sanitizer.\nWERROR: set to ON to error on warnings, mostly used for CI.\n\nTroubleshooting\nGit submodules out of date\nSome common build issues can be resolved by updating submodules and cleaning the distribution:\ncd MAVSDK\ngit submodule update --recursive\nrm -rf build\nThen attempt to build again.\nMSVC vs. MingW\nWe only try to support building using MSVC, MingW is not working, mostly because the defines/flags for it are missing.\nUndefined reference to mavsdk...\nIf you only just built the library and installed it system-wide may also need to update the linker cache.\nOn Linux this is done with sudo ldconfig.\n  © Dronecode 2017-2020.

Abbreviations are only to be used for small scopes and should not be exposed in public APIs.\nAll variables that have a physical unit should have the unit in the variable name (e.g. _m for meters, _m_s for meters/second).\nVariable and method names should be snake_case and class/struct/enum names CamelCase. Private variables should start with an underscore, e.g.: _variable_name.\nTry to exit functions early instead of nesting ifs (read why).\nWe don't use exceptions but use error codes. There are pros and cons for exceptions but given that the public API should be as simple as possible, it makes sense to refrain from exceptions altogether.\nThe use of std::bind is discouraged.

See installation guide if that is not already the case.\nThen build the example:\ncd example/takeoff_land/\ncmake -Bbuild -H.\ncmake --build\n\n\n if MAVSDK is installed locally (e.g. on Windows) you need to pass the location to cmake:\ncmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=wherever_mavsdk_is_locally_installed\n\nRunning the Examples \nYou can then run the example, specifying the connection URL as the first argument.\nWhen running with the Simulator, you will use the connection string: udp://:14540\nOn Linux/macOS you would run the following (from the /build directory):\nbuild/takeoff_and_land udp://:14540\n\nFor Windows you would run the following (from the \\build\\Debug\\ directory):\nbuild\\Debug\\takeoff_and_land.exe udp://:14540\n\n\n Most examples will create a binary with the same name as the example.\nThe name that is used is specified in the CMakeLists.txt file as the first value in the call to add_executable().\n\nIf you have already started the simulation the example code should connect to PX4,\nand you will be able to observe behaviour through the SDK terminal, SITL terminal, and/or QGroundControl.\n  © Dronecode 2017-2020.

between versions.\nIt covers both breaking (incompatible) and non-breaking changes.\nSemantic Versioning\nMAVSDK follows semver/Semantic Versioning conventions where as possible.\nThe version number has the format: major.minor.patch.\nIndividual parts of the number are iterated when the:\n\nmajor: API is changed, or functionality is removed.\nminor: API is extended, functionality is added.\npatch: API is not changed, functionality is not changed, but a bug is fixed.\n\nThis means that breaking changes to the API result in a bump of the major version number (e.g. 1.4.3 to 2.0.0).\n\n At time of writing, breaking/incompatible changes are not resulting in the major version number being increased!\n  We plan to release version 1.0.0 in the near future, after which the above strategy will be adopted (i.e. currently breaking changes can occur in both minor and patch releases).\n\n0.38\nMission\nThe functionality to import missions from QGroundControl (.plan files) has been moved from the Mission to the MissionRaw plugin.\nThe reasoning was that the Mission API didn't support most of the functionality that can be part of a QGC mission, and therefore will likely have not work as expected.\nWith MissionRaw it's just a simple 1:1 mapping and the results should be more predictable.\nThe old API was:\n// Import Mission items from QGC plan\nstd::pair import_res =\n    mission.import_qgroundcontrol_mission(qgc_plan);\nThe new API is:\n// Import Mission items from QGC plan\nstd::pair import_res =\n    mission_raw.import_qgroundcontrol_mission(qgc_plan);\nv0.33\nThere are some changes in how systems are discovered, connected and accessed with this release.\nThe previous APIs are still available but marked deprecated and they will be removed in the future.\nThe deprecations are also implemented as compiler warnings.\nDiscovery of systems\nThe 64bit (8 bytes) uuid is deprecated because it needed to be extended to 18 bytes.\nFor more info, see this MAVLink pull request.\nTherefore, the discovery no longer contains the uuid.\nIf the uid is required it can be found in the Info plugin.\nPrevious way of discovering systems:\nMavsdk mavsdk;\n\nstd::promise discover_promise;\nauto discover_future = discover_promise.get_future();\n\nmavsdk.register_on_discover([&discover_promise](uint64_t uuid) {\n    std::cout \nNew way of discovering a system:\nMavsdk mavsdk;\n\nauto new_system_promise = std::promise>{};\nauto new_system_future = new_system_promise.get_future();\nmavsdk.subscribe_on_new_system([&mavsdk, &new_system_promise]() {\n    new_system_promise.set_value(mavsdk.systems().at(0));\n    mavsdk.subscribe_on_new_system(nullptr);\n});\n\nauto system = new_system_future.get();\n\nTo be notified about a system timing out later, or being discovered again, you can now use:\nsystem->subscribe_is_connected([](bool is_connected) {\n    if (is_connected) {\n        std::cout \nIf you prefer to use sync APIs / polling, you can use this to wait for a vehicle and connect:\nMavsdk mavsdk;\n\nwhile (mavsdk.systems().size() == 0) {\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n}\n\nauto system = mavsdk.systems().at(0);\n\nAccessing systems\nWe aim to make the API of MAVSDK as easy and safe to use as possible.\nHowever, as we'll see below, this still comes with trade-offs.\nWhen designing the API we decided to expose the MAVSDK user a reference to a system System&, which means the system will always be instantiated and there won't be any segfaults trying to access a system that is null.\nThis mostly worked fine, however, had some drawbacks:\n\nWithout an actual system discovered the System& is basically a null reference that won't really work.\nThis is not really obvious unless you check its system and component IDs for 0.\nThis is not very intuitive and also means additional checks inside the plugins are required.\nThe ownership model is not very clear as Mavsdk owns the System but then each plugin only seems to require the System.\nInternally, the plugins still require Mavsdk to be alive and working but that's not apparent through the API.\nIf there are multiple sytems they need to be accessed using the uuid.\nThis seems like a crutch because essentially we would just like to have a std::vector of systems but of course that's not posible with references.\n\nAs the API for the uid was about the change anyway (see above) it seemed time to redesign the API to access systems with these considerations in mind.\nThe basic change is to move away from the reference System& to a shared pointer std::shared_ptr.\nThis brings the following advantages:\n\nNo more confusing null reference systems.\nClearer ownership model as a System is now shared between Mavsdk and the plugins.\nNice getter std::vector> systems() allowing easier access to all systems.\n\nPrevious way to get a system:\nSystem& system = mavsdk.system();\n\nNew way to get a system:\nstd::shared_ptr system = mavsdk.systems().at(0);\n\nOr just:\nauto system = mavsdk.systems().at(0);\n\n\n The std::vector returned by systems() might be empty if no system has been discovered yet, and the above call will abort.\n\nv0.25\nThere are several changes in this release (from v0.24.0) because the C++ plugins are now partially auto-generated from the proto files.\nWhile this causes some painful changes, it has several advantages:\n\nBetter consistency between C++ and other languages for naming/docs/functionality.\nAutomatically propagate features to language wrappers such as Python.\n\n\n It's also worth looking at the integration tests and examples between the versions to see how things changed: GitHub diff view.\n\nThe notes below try to give an overview over the changes as well as give some background on why they were deemed to be necessary.\nGeneral Changes\nEnums\n\nEnum naming is now CamelCase instead of ALL_UPPERCASE:\nAction::RESULT -> Action::Result\nTelemetry::FLIGHT_MODE -> Telemetry::FlightMode\n\n\n\n For enums, there is also a script that you can run to fix them in one batch.\n\n  The reasoning behind this change is to avoid clashes with macros.\n  For instance we had conflicts with ERROR or SOCKET_ERROR on Windows (issue).\n\nPrinting of enums is easier:\nOld:\nstd::cout New:\nstd::cout With auto-generation it is quite easy to make sure everything is printable using streams and we can drop the custom _str functions.\nTo get a std::string from operator you can use:\n#include \n\nstd::stringstream ss;\nss \n\nCallback types\nThe typedefs for callback types are no longer suffixed with _t and in CamelCase instead of all_lower_case, and they use the more modern using syntax rather than typedef e.g.:\nOld:\ntypedef std::function foo_callback_t;\nNew:\nusing FooCallback = std::function;\nThis change was decided in order to move with the modern C++ recommendation as much as possible and also allow it to be used with templates.\nMethods\n\nMethods representing an infinite stream (i.e. that take a callback repeatedly receiving events, until they get unsubscribed) are now prefixed with subscribe_ instead of being suffixed with _async.\nOld:\ntelemetry->position_async(...);\nNew:\ntelemetry->subscribe_position(...);\nFinite streams keep the _async suffix, e.g. calibrate_magnetometer_async(...).\nThe reasoning is that it makes infinite streams clearly distinguishable from finite streams and requests which are async. Also, it allows to potentially add unsubscribe in the future.\n\nMethods returning a bool are now mostly prefixed with is_. E.g. is_health_ok instead of health_ok.\n\n\nTelemetry\nTypes\nSome of the types have been renamed for consistency:\n\nAccelerationNED -> AccelerationFrd\nAngularVelocityNED -> AngularVelocityFrd\nIMUReadingNED -> Imu\nMagneticFieldNED -> MagneticFieldFrd\nGroundSpeedNED -> VelocityNed\nSpeedBody -> VelocityBody\n\nThe changes were mostly for consistency, or correctness.\nMethods\nIn the same way, some of the methods changed:\n\nset_rate_ground_speed -> set_rate_velocity_ned\nground_speed_async -> subscribe_velocity_ned\n\nMission\nClasses\nThe separate class MissionItem is now just a POD struct inside Mission, so Mission::MissionItem.\nMethods\n\nProgress is now MissionProgress:\nOld:\nsubscribe_progress(progress_callback_t callback);\n\nNew:\nsubscribe_mission_progress(MissionProgressCallback callback);\n\nThis makes it clear that the progress is for the mission and not the upload/download.\n\nThe interface to upload a mission no longer uses a std::vector of std::shared_ptrs but a std::vector of the actual structs.\nIt is further wrapped inside MissionPlan in order to support mission settings.\nOld:\ntypedef std::function result_callback_t;\n\nupload_mission_async(std::vector> items, result_callback_t callback);\n\nNew:\nstruct MissionPlan {\n    std::vector mission_items;\n}\n\nupload_mission_async(Mission::MissionPlan mission_plan, ResultCallback callback);\n\nCopying all items by value instead of using pointers might seem like overhead, however, there are a few arguments against that:\n\nThe items were copied anyway inside of the mission plugin in order not to mess with the user's data. This change shows that in the API instead of hiding it.\nReference counting in std::shared_ptr is also overhead, especially when done for each and every mission item.\nOnly profiling will tell if a vector of pointers or a vector of structs is actually more performant. It depends on the number of items, caches,  etc..\nShared ownership of data should be prevented as much as possible, unless really required, and can lead to interesting effects on destruction. Passing by value is often just easier and more intuitive.\n\n\nSimilarly to download a mission:\nOld:\ntypedef std::function)> mission_items_and_result_callback_t;\n\ndownload_mission_async(mission_items_and_result_callback_t, callback)\n\nNew:\nusing DownloadMissionCallback = std::function;\nvoid download_mission_async(const Mission::DownloadMissionCallback& callback);\n\n\n There are now also sync methods to upload and download a mission: upload_mission and download_mission.\n\n\nSome methods now return a std::pair instead of just a bool to cover the case where a request fails.\nOld:\nbool mission_finished();\n\nNew:\nstd::pair is_mission_finished();\n\nThe fields of a pair can be accessed with .first and .second.\n\n\nCalibration\nThe results IN_PROGRESS and INSTRUCTION disappear in favor of Next. Now, Success means that the function finished successfully, Next represents a new element of the stream and all the other results mean that the function finished with an error (described by the result).\nGeofence\nMethods\nThe naming of the upload method has changed to match the mission and mission_raw plugins:\nOld:\nsend_geofence_async(...);\nNew:\nupload_geofence_async(...);\nOr:\nupload_geofence(...);\nTypes\nStructs are usually no longer nested inside other structs but flatter due to the complexity it would pose for auto-generation:\nOld:\nGeofence::Polygon::Point point;\nNow:\nGeofence::Point point;\nAlso, we no longer pass polygons with std::shared_ptr but by value Geofence::Polygon.\nOffboard\nTypes\nMatching with the rest, acronyms are not all capitalized anymore, mostly because that's easier to deal with in auto-generation:\nPositionNEDYaw -> PositionNedYaw\nVelocityNED -> VelocityNedYaw\n  © Dronecode 2017-2020.

The callbacks are stored in a queue. If the user does not return quickly enough from the callback, it can happen that the user callback queue fills up.\nIf a callback takes more than one second, the user sees the warning:\n[02:56:26|Warn ] Callback took more than 1 second to run.\nSee: https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/main/en/cpp/troubleshooting.html#user_callbacks (system_impl.cpp:327)\nAt 10 queued callbacks, the user sees the warning:\n[02:56:26|Warn ] User callback queue too slow.\nSee: https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/main/en/cpp/troubleshooting.html#user_callbacks (system_impl.cpp:1213)\nAt 100 queued callbacks, the user sees the error message:\n[02:56:35|Error] User callback queue overflown\nSee: https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/main/en/cpp/troubleshooting.html#user_callbacks (system_impl.cpp:1218)\nHow to debug this?\nTo determine which callback is blocking the queue, you can set the environment variable MAVSDK_CALLBACK_DEBUGGING to 1, which will print more debug information and abort the program as soon as the problem occurs.\nMAVSDK_CALLBACK_DEBUGGING=1 ./my_executable_using_mavsdk\nor:\nexport MAVSDK_CALLBACK_DEBUGGING=1\n./my_executable_using_mavsdk\nYou should then see something like this hinting at which callback might be responsible:\n[03:00:02|Warn ] Callback called from telemetry_impl.cpp:533 took more than 1 second to run. (system_impl.cpp:320)\n[2]    1261673 abort (core dumped)  MAVSDK_CALLBACK_DEBUGGING=1  ...\"\nNote that this does not point to the blocking code, but only to the place where your blocking callback was called.\nHow to avoid this?\nThe rule is to spend as little time and CPU in the callbacks as possible.\nFor instance, inside the callbacks you should not wait on other events or sleep.\nIf you really want to do something that takes longer inside a callback, the workaround is to just spawn that activity on another thread, e.g. using std::thread:\nvoid my_callback(Telemetry::Position position)\n{\n    std::thread([position]() {\n        std::this_thread_sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(3));\n        my_delayed_action(position);\n    }).detach();\n}\nWhy did this use to work?\nBefore introducing the callback queue, we used a thread pool of 3 threads to call user callbacks.\nThe thread pool was written to avoid everything from stalling if a user blocked in one of the callbacks.\nIt generally worked provided the user did not block in more than 3 callbacks at any given time.\nHowever, it had also some disadvantages:\n\nDue to the thread pool multiple threads could call a function at any given time.\nThis means that one callback can be called from at least two threads at the same time which is quite likely if the callback is called at a high rate.\nThis can create race conditions on the user side unless a mutex is used to prevent this.\nHowever, it's not very intuitive that a mutex is needed for that, and mutexes in general should be avoided, if possible, for performance reasons.\nSuch race conditions also showed up as CI test failures, see: MAVSDK#1010, MAVSDK#1045.\nFor developers the old thread pool behaviour was unclear and unpredictable.\nBasically, without code inspection, it was difficult to know if blocking in a callback is safe or not.\nWhen trying with one blocking callback, it would work, however, this can create a false sense of security as with 3 blocking callbacks it would suddenly lock up.\nPreviously, when this happened, it was difficult to debug because it would either lead to a crash on destruction, or lock up at which point the backtrace of all threads need to be looked at using gdb.\n\n  © Dronecode 2017-2020.

For instance, action.proto becomes Action.java in MAVSDK-Java.\nIn some languages (typically C++), we need to generate multiple source files out of one proto definition file, and this is the reason why the C++ generation script runs protoc in multiple passes, once for each template (e.g. \"templates/plugin_h\" defines the templates to generate action.h, telemetry.h, ..., and \"templates/plugin_cpp\" is responsible for action.cpp, telemetry.cpp, ...).\nAll the MAVSDK repositories contain some kind of generate_from_proto.sh file, and a templates/ directory:\n\nMAVSDK-C++: script, templates\nMAVSDK-Python: script, templates\nMAVSDK-Swift: script, templates\nMAVSDK-Java: script, templates\nMAVSDK-C#: script, templates\nMAVSDK-Go: script, templates\n\nAdding a New Feature\nWhen adding a new feature to MAVSDK it is important to think first about the API that is required, and later about the implementation needed to enable the feature. This is not only because MAVSDK strives to have a simple and safe API but also comes from the fact that a new feature needs to be defined in the API first and can then be implemented (using the autogenerated files) in a later step.\nTo add a new feature, follow the steps on how to write plugins.\n  © Dronecode 2017-2020.

An example would be the takeoff command of the action plugin:\nservice ActionService {\n    rpc Takeoff(TakeoffRequest) returns(TakeoffResponse) {}\n    // all other services\n}\n\nmessage TakeoffRequest {}\nmessage TakeoffResponse {\n    ActionResult action_result = 1;\n}\nIn this case the request has no argument and no return value except the result but this can vary, e.g. for getters and setters:\nservice ActionService {\n    rpc GetReturnToLaunchAltitude(GetReturnToLaunchAltitudeRequest) returns(GetReturnToLaunchAltitudeResponse) {}\n    rpc SetReturnToLaunchAltitude(SetReturnToLaunchAltitudeRequest) returns(SetReturnToLaunchAltitudeResponse) {}\n    // all other services\n}\n\nmessage GetReturnToLaunchAltitudeRequest {}\nmessage GetReturnToLaunchAltitudeResponse {\n    ActionResult action_result = 1;\n    float relative_altitude_m = 2;\n}\n\nmessage SetReturnToLaunchAltitudeRequest {\n    float relative_altitude_m = 1;\n}\nmessage SetReturnToLaunchAltitudeResponse {\n    ActionResult action_result = 1;\n}\n\n that requests can defined SYNC, ASYNC, or BOTH using option (mavsdk.options.async_type) = ...;.\n  The choice depends on the functionality that is being implemented and how it would generally be used.\n  There are no hard rules, it's something that makes sense to be discussed one by one in a pull request.\n  The default implementation is BOTH.\n\nSubscriptions:\nA subscription is triggered once and will then continuously send responses as a stream. An example would be a the position information of the telemetry plugin:\nservice TelemetryService {\n    rpc SubscribePosition(SubscribePositionRequest) returns(stream PositionResponse) {}\n    // all other services\n}\n\n\nmessage SubscribePositionRequest {}\nmessage PositionResponse {\n    Position position = 1;\n}\n\n that subscriptions also can defined SYNC, ASYNC, or BOTH using option (mavsdk.options.async_type) = ...;.\n  The sync implementation of a subscription is just a getter for the last received value.\nNote that subscriptions can be defined finite using option (mavsdk.options.is_finite) = true;.\n  This means that the stream of messages will end at some point instead of continuing indefinitely. An example would be progress updates about a calibration which eventually finishes.\n\nAdd API to proto\nThe first step should be to define the user API in the proto repository.\nThis repository is part of the MAVSDK as a submodule in the proto/ directory.\nYou usually want to work from master in the proto/ directory, and then create a feature branch with your additions:\ncd proto\ngit switch main\ngit pull\ngit switch -c my-new-plugin\ncd ../\nNow you can add a folder with your proto file (or copy an existing one and rename it) and draft the API.\nOnce the API is defined, it makes sense to commit the changes, push them and make a pull request to MAVSDK-Proto to get feedback from the MAVSDK maintainers.\nGenerate .h and .cpp files\nOnce the proto file has been created, you can generate all files required for the new plugin.\n\nRun the configure step to prepare the tools required:cmake -DBUILD_MAVSDK_SERVER=ON -Bbuild/default -H.\n\nInstall protoc_gen_mavsdk which is required for the auto-generation:pip3 install --user protoc_gen_mavsdk  # Or however you install pip packages\n\nRun the auto-generation:tools/generate_from_protos.sh\n\nFix style after auto-generation:tools/fix_style.sh .\n\n\n\n the files my_new_plugin.h and my_new_plugin.cpp are generated and overwritten everytime the script is run.\n  However, the files my_new_plugin_impl.h and my_new_plugin_impl.cpp are only generated once.\n  To re-generate them, delete them and run the script again.\n  This approach is used to prevent the script from overwriting your local changes.\n\nActually implement MAVLink messages\nYou can now add the actual \"business logic\" which is usually sending and receiving MAVLink messages, waiting for timeouts, etc.\nAll implementation goes into the files my_new_plugin_impl.h and my_new_plugin_impl.cpp or additional files for separete classes required.\nYou can also add unit tests with unittest_source_files, as discussed below.\nThe standard plugins can be reviewed for guidance on\nhow to write plugin code, including how to send and process MAVLink messages.\nPlugin Code\nPlugin Base Class\nAll plugins should derive their implementation from PluginImplBase (core/plugin_impl_base.h) and override virtual methods as needed.\nPlugin Enable/Disable\nThe SDK provides virtual methods that a plugin should implement to allow the core to better manage resources.\nFor example, to prevent callback being created before the System is instantiated, or messages being sent when a vehicle is not connected.\nPlugin authors should provide an implementation of the following PluginImplBase pure virtual methods:\n\ninit()/deinit(): These are called when a system is created and just before it is destroyed. These should be used for setting up and cleaning everything that depends on having the System instantiated. This includes calls that set up callbacks.\nenable()/disable(): These are called when a vehicle is discovered or has timed out. They should be used for managing resources needed to access a connected system/vehicle (e.g. getting a parameter or changing a setting).\n\nAdditional detail is provided for methods below.\ninit() \nvirtual void init() = 0\n\nThe init() method is called when a plugin is instantiated.\nThis happens when a System is constructed (this does not mean that the system actually exists and is connected - it might just be an empty dummy system).\nPlugins should do initialization steps with other parts of the SDK at this state, e.g. set up callbacks with _parent (DeviceImpl).\ndeinit() \nvirtual void deinit() = 0\n\nThe deinit() method is called before a plugin is destroyed. This usually happens only at the very end, when a MAVSDK instance is destroyed.\nPlugins should cleanup anything that was set up during init().\nenable() \nvirtual void enable() = 0\n\nThe enable() method is called when a system is discovered (connected).\nPlugins should do all initialization/configuration steps that require a system to be connected.\nFor example, setting/getting parameters.\nIf any threads, call_every or timeouts are needed, they can be started in this method.\ndisable() \nvirtual void disable() = 0\n\nThe disable() method is called when a system has timed out.\nThe method is also called before deinit() is called to stop any systems with active plugins from communicating (in order to prevent warnings and errors because communication to the system no longer works).\nIf any threads, call_every, or timeouts are running, they should be stopped in this method.\nTest Code \nTests must be created for all new and updated plugin code.\nThe tests should be exhaustive, and cover all aspects of using the plugin API.\nThe Google Test Primer\nprovides an excellent overview of how tests are written and used.\nWriting Unit Tests\nMost of the existing plugins do not have unit tests,\nbecause we do not yet have the ability to mock MAVLink communications (needed to test most plugins).\nUnit tests are therefore considered optional!\n\n Comprehensive integration tests should be written instead, with the simulator providing appropriate MAVLink messages.\n\nAdding Unit Tests \nUnit test files are stored in the same directory as their associated source code.\nIn order to include a test in the SDK unit test program (unit_tests_runner),\nit must be added to the UNIT_TEST_SOURCES variable in the plugin CMakeLists.txt file.\nFor example, to add the example_foo_test.cpp unit test you would\nappend the following lines to its CMakeLists.txt:\nlist(APPEND UNIT_TEST_SOURCES\n    ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/plugins/mission/example_foo_test.cpp\n)\nset(UNIT_TEST_SOURCES ${UNIT_TEST_SOURCES} PARENT_SCOPE)\n\nUnit Test Code\nUnit tests typically include the file to be tested, mavsdk.h, and gtest.h.\nThere are no standard shared test unit resources so test functions are declared using TEST.\nAll tests in a file should share the same test-case name (the first argument to TEST).\nWriting Integration Tests \nMAVSDK provides the integration_tests_runner application for running the integration tests and some helper code to make it easier to log tests and run them against the simulator.\n\n Check out the Google Test Primer\nand the integration_tests\nfor our existing plugins to better understand how to write your own!\n\nAdding Integration Tests\nIn order to run an integration test it needs to be added to the integration_tests_runner program.\nIntegration tests for core functionality and plugins delivered by the project\nare stored in MAVSDK/src/integration_tests.\nThe files are added to the test program in that folder's\nCMakeLists.txt file:\n# This includes all GTests that run integration tests\nadd_executable(integration_tests_runner\n    ../core/unittests_main.cpp\n    simple_connect.cpp\n    async_connect.cpp\n    telemetry_simple.cpp\n    ...\n    gimbal.cpp\n    transition_multicopter_fixedwing.cpp\n    follow_me.cpp\n)\n\nIntegration Test Files/Code\nThe main MAVSDK-specific functionality is provided by integration_test_helper.h.\nThis provides access to the Plugin/Test Logger and a shared test class SitlTest for setting up and tearing down the PX4 simulator.\n\n All tests running against SITL can be declared using TEST_F and have a first argument SitlTest as shown.\n  This is required in order to use the shared class to set up and tear down the simulator between tests.\n\nFor reference inspect the existing integration tests.\nExample Code\n\n It is quicker and easier to write and modify integration tests than examples.\nDo not write example code until the plugin has been accepted!\n\nA simple example should be written that demonstrates basic usage of its API by 3rd parties.\nThe example need not cover all functionality, but should demonstrate enough that developers can see how it is used and how the example might be extended.\nWhere possible examples should demonstrate realistic use cases such that the code can usefully be copied and reused by external developers.\nDocumentation\nIn-Source Comments\nThe public API must be fully documented using the proto files.\n\n The in-source comments will be compiled to markdown and included in the API Reference.\nThe process is outlined in Documentation > API Reference.\n\nInternal/implementation classes need not be documented, but should be written using expressive naming of variables and functions to help the reader.\nAnything unexpected or special however warrants an explanation as a comment.\nExample Code Documentation\nThe plugin example should be documented in markdown following the same pattern as the existing examples.\nGenerally this involves explaining what the example does and displaying the source.\nThe explanation of how the code works is usually deferred to guide documentation.\nGuide Documentation \nIdeally, guide documentation should be created. This should be based on example code.\nThe purpose of the guide is to:\n\nShow how different parts of the API can be used together\nHighlight usage patterns and limitations that may not be obvious from API reference\nProvide code fragments that can easily be reused\n\n  © Dronecode 2017-2020.

Serial, TCP, and UDP connections are supported, see notes on connection.\nWhy is libCURL a dependency?\nlibCURL will be required to download the camera definition file which is referenced in CAMERA_INFORMATION.\nIt might also come in handy whenever any other REST resources are required.\nHow are plugins added?\nCheck out C++/Contributing/Plugins.\nCan a plugin depend on another one?\nYes - but it should not!\nThe idea is that plugins don't have any coupling between each other which allows for any plugin to be changed or removed without breaking the rest.\nThis will lead to some duplication at places, that's an acceptable trade-off.\nIf the same code is used in many places, it can always be moved to core and get re-used from there.\nOver time we have sometimes moved functionality from plugins to the core if it was exposed in multiple plugins (e.g. mission upload/download has been moved to the core so it can be used in the Mission plugin as well as the MissionRaw and Geofence plugins.\nCan MAVSDK run on an embedded platform / microcontroller\nMAVSDK is generally written a bit higher level, geared towards ARM devices such as a Raspberry Pi, smartphone or faster/better.\nAs it doesn't actually use too much compute, it could in theory be run on a microcontroller such as an ARM Cortex M4, however, it would require the POSIX APIs for serial and networking communication as well as the C++ standard library for things like std::thread or std::vector.\nThe recommendation for a microcontroller would be to use the pure C MAVLink headers.\nWhy is MAVLink Passthrough only available in C++\nThe C++ MAVLink passthrough plugin basically exposes the direct C MAVLink API.\nWhile it would be nice to have access to all MAVLink messages in the language wrappers, there are some technical challenges:\n\nEssentially, it would mean that all MAVLink APIs would have to be duplicated by the proto APIs.\nThis would increase the API and code size considerably.\nAlternatively, the API could be exposed without types, using some sort of runtime access like get_message(\"ATTITUDE\").get_field(\"pitch\").as_float().\nThis would come with the cost of no type safety and runtime overhead for parsing the strings.\n\nFrom a MAVSDK project point of view, there is also an advantage of not having a passthrough available in language wrappers; it encourages that required features are contributed back to the open-source project, rather than implemented in private using passthrough, and thus benefitting everyone.\n  © Dronecode 2017-2020.
