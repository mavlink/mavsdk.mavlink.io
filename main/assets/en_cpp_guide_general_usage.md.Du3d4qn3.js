You can see how these are used in the example code.</p><h2 id="callbacks" tabindex="-1">Callbacks <a class="header-anchor" href="#callbacks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Callbacks&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Some of the APIs use callbacks, e.g. subscriptions to a stream like <a href="./../api_reference/classmavsdk_1_1_telemetry.html#classmavsdk_1_1_telemetry_1a61bda57b3ca47000ea7e4758b2a33134">Telemetry::subscribe_position(PositionCallback callback)</a> or async functions like <a href="./../api_reference/classmavsdk_1_1_action.html#classmavsdk_1_1_action_1ab658d938970326db41709d83e02b41e6">Action::takeoff_async(ResultCallback callback)</a>.</p><p>All user callbacks are called from one thread.

It has primarily been tested for use with multicopters, but also has basic support for fixed wing and <a href="./../guide/vtol.html">VTOL</a>.</p><p>The APIs include methods that do not make sense for other vehicle types - including &quot;takeoff&quot; and &quot;land&quot;. While ground vehicles may work, they are not supported and are untested. Similarly, other autopilots may well work, but, they are not explicitly supported and are untested.</p><h3 id="connection_string" tabindex="-1">Connection Strings <a class="header-anchor" href="#connection_string" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Connection Strings {#connection_string}&quot;">​</a></h3><p>MAVSDK monitors a specified port for vehicles (for the C++ API see <a href="./../guide/connections.html">Connecting to Systems (Vehicles)</a>).

The information is supplied to callback subscribers as soon as message updates are received. Clients can also query the API synchronously, and will get the information from the last received message (depending on channel latency, this information will become increasingly &quot;stale&quot; between messages).</p><p>The rate at which update messages are sent by the vehicle can be specified using the API (but will be limited by the bandwidth of the channel). Developers need to use a channel and a message update rate that allows their desired control algorithm to be effective - there is no point trying to use computer vision over an unreliable high-latency link.</p><p><code>Info</code> information does not change for a particular vehicle, so will be accurate whenever read.</p><h3 id="actions-offboard" tabindex="-1">Actions/Offboard <a class="header-anchor" href="#actions-offboard" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Actions/Offboard&quot;">​</a></h3><p><code>Action</code> methods (and any other &quot;vehicle instructions&quot;) return when the vehicle has confirmed that the message was received and will be acted on (or not). The methods do not wait for the commanded action to complete.</p><p>So, for example, the <a href="./../api_reference/classmavsdk_1_1_action.html#classmavsdk_1_1_action_1af6429e1bdb2875deebfe98ed53da3d41">Action::land()</a> method returns as soon as the vehicle confirms it will land, but will actually land at some later point.</p><p>The implication is that developers will need to separately monitor the completion of the requested actions, if this is important to the application.</p><h3 id="missions" tabindex="-1">Missions <a class="header-anchor" href="#missions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Missions&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The <code>Mission</code> and <code>MissionItem</code> APIs provide a the most useful <em>subset</em> of MAVLink mission commands as a developer-friendly API.</p><p>Not every mission command behaviour supported by the protocol and PX4 will be supported by the SDK. For example, at time of writing the API does not allow you to specify commands that jump back to previous mission items.</p><p>The API allows you to download/import missions. Note however that this will fail if the mission contains a command that is not supported by the API.</p>',40)]))}const u=t(s,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,u as default};
